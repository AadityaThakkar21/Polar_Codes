# Polar Codes: An Introduction and Implementation

Polar codes are a groundbreaking class of error-correcting codes introduced by Erdal ArÄ±kan in 2009. They are the first family of codes proven to achieve the theoretical limits of channel capacity for symmetric binary-input memoryless channels, making them a cornerstone of modern communication systems like 5G. This project provides an educational implementation of polar codes, focusing on their core principles, encoding/decoding algorithms, and performance analysis.
